The diffusion model is known for its ability to effectively handle noise and uncertainties in data. By integrating these two models, we aim to create a synergistic approach that surpasses the limitations of standalone methods and provides superior results in terms of visual quality, realism, and perceptual fidelity.Current image restoration methods face challenges in handling diverse degradations, motivating the exploration of a novel approach for improved results.

The resulting model is proficient in producing impressively photorealistic high-quality photos of faces and grants control over the characteristic of the created image.StyleGAN utilizes a progressive growing strategy during training, gradually increasing the resolution of generated images over successive layers of the network. This approach enhances training stability and facilitates the generation of high-resolution images with fine details.
Two approaches for improving the visual quality of super-resolved images:
1. Style GAN + image processing 
2. Style GAN + diffusion modelling
The first method involves applying mean and median filters to reduce noise in the output image, while the second approach uses diffusion modelling to remove noise from the input image before passing it through Style GAN.
